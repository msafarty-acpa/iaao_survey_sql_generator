# iaao_survey_sql_generator
Generates sql statements to create tables with survey data by reading survey data published in xlsx

## progress update
The functions to generate SQL appear to work but they need to be physically run and then added as plaintext in the SQL file for insert_data.

We might consider an option where we just make a function that runs them all and concatenates their text so it's simpler. TBD! Ran out of time leading up to this commit. Midway through question 5 by running them manually.
